# hw-6-weather-dashboard

## Description

I have created a weather dashboard that runs in the browser. It features dynamically generated HTML and CSS and uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for the city that is searched for by the user. The search history persists through local storage so that previously searched weather data can be easily retrieved.
